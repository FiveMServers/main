            With constructive waves, the wavefront is gently sloping and gains a little height, breaks and spills onto the beach with water spreading a long way up the gently sloping beach; they are typically found in sheltered bays and spits, where they build up sandy beaches.

            With destructive waves, they destroy beaches; as they approach the coast, they gain height and plunge onto a steep beach and do not travel far up it. The force generated by a destructive breaking wave can also erode a headland; they are more common in winter than in summer.
